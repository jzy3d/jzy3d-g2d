There are dependencies on jzy3d-api, so you should either clone jzy3d-api (git clone https://github.com/jzy3d/jzy3d-api.git), or add to your classpath:
jzy3d api (jzy3d.org)
jogl2 (https://github.com/jzy3d/jzy3d-api/tree/master/lib/jogl* or go to jogamp.org)
other dependencies (https://github.com/jzy3d/jzy3d-api/tree/master/lib/misc)

Disclaimer:

Jzy3d G2D is only a proof of concept showing how to build 3d charts based on Java2d.

Although not exhaustive, here is a list of feature not supported/explored:
- mouse controller on a standard frame allowing to update viewpoint
- text renderers
- axe box
- colorbars
