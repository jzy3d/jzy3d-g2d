There are dependencies on jzy3d-api, so you should either clone jzy3d-api (git clone https://github.com/jzy3d/jzy3d-api.git), or add to your classpath:
<ul>
<li>jzy3d api (jzy3d.org)
<li>jogl2 (https://github.com/jzy3d/jzy3d-api/tree/master/lib/jogl* or go to jogamp.org)
<li>other dependencies (https://github.com/jzy3d/jzy3d-api/tree/master/lib/misc)
</ul>
